# Step 6: Transaction Balancing Interface - Implementation Summary

## Completed Components

### Backend Implementation
1. **Transaction Controller:**
   - Added `getSuggestedMatches` endpoint to find matching entries for an unbalanced entry line
   - Added `balanceTransactions` endpoint to combine two transactions into a balanced one

2. **Transaction Routes:**
   - Added new routes for transaction balancing:
     - `GET /api/transactions/matches/:id` - Suggests matching entries
     - `POST /api/transactions/balance` - Combines transactions

3. **Tests:**
   - Added integration tests for transaction balancing endpoints
   - Fixed issues to ensure proper matching of transactions

### Frontend Implementation
1. **API Service:**
   - Added new methods in transactionApi:
     - `getSuggestedMatches` to fetch potential matches 
     - `balanceTransactions` to combine transactions

2. **TransactionBalancer Component:**
   - Created a new React component with:
     - Display of unbalanced transactions
     - Entry line selection
     - Suggested matches display
     - Drag-and-drop functionality using react-beautiful-dnd
     - Success/error message handling

3. **App Navigation:**
   - Added a new route for the Transaction Balancer
   - Updated navigation menu with a "Balance Transactions" link

4. **Manual Testing:**
   - Created comprehensive testing documents

## Features Implemented

1. **Transaction Search and Filtering:**
   - Automatically shows only unbalanced transactions
   - Allows selecting specific entry lines for balancing

2. **Match Suggestions:**
   - Finds potential matching entries based on:
     - Opposite entry type (debit/credit)
     - Same amount
     - Close transaction date range (Â±15 days)
     - Only from unbalanced transactions

3. **Drag-and-Drop Interface:**
   - Intuitive drag-and-drop functionality
   - Visual feedback during drag operations
   - Clearly marked drop zone

4. **Transaction Balancing:**
   - Combines two transactions into one
   - Moves all entry lines to the source transaction
   - Merges transaction descriptions and notes
   - Removes the target transaction
   - Updates balance status automatically

## Testing Strategy

1. **Backend Integration Tests:**
   - Tests for `getSuggestedMatches` endpoint
   - Tests for `balanceTransactions` endpoint
   - Error handling tests for edge cases

2. **Manual Frontend Testing Guide:**
   - Detailed step-by-step tests for UI functionality
   - Test cases for error handling and edge cases
   - Visual feedback verification

## Next Steps

With Step 6 completed, the application now has a fully functional transaction balancing interface. The next step (Step 7) would be to implement Transaction Balancing Rules to provide even more automation in matching transactions.
